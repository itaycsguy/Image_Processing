Note: In excersize c and e - The Trapez [affine col] looks weighted too much because of the difference between the length of the Trapez to the length of the squere -> This is not a bug!!!
Note_2: mapImage returns uint8 type of image - the casting is made up inside the function - keep attention.

Thanks and have fun! :)
